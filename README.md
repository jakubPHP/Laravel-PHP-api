The project is based on the Laravel framework and involves implementing a REST API for a class called People. This class will contain basic information about individuals, such as their first name, last name, phone number, street address, and city or country.

To manage the data for People objects, you need to create appropriate controllers, models, and migrations.

A possible project structure could be as follows:

1. Create a migration for the people table, which will include columns corresponding to the properties of the People class, including first name, last name, phone number, street address, city/country, and any additional properties.

2. Create a People model that represents an instance of the People class. In the model, define the necessary attributes, relationships, and validations.

3. Create a PeopleController that will contain methods responsible for handling the REST API requests related to People objects, such as retrieving a list of people, creating a new person, updating person's data, deleting a person, etc.

4. Configure the routing in the web.php or api.php file to set up the API paths, which will serve as access points for operations on People objects.
